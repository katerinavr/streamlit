**One class classification for co-crystal design**


The aim of this app is to provide an in depth exploration of the application of the one class classification method for accelerating co-crystals design. The co-crystal data were extracted from the [Cambridge Structural Database](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/csd/), the possible co-formers from the [ZINC15 Database](https://zinc15.docking.org/) and the molecular features were calculated using the [Mordred library](https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred).
With this interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app we hope to provide an easy to implement tool for anyone interested in co-crystals design.
